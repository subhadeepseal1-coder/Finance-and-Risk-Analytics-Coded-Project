# Finance-and-Risk-Analytics-Coded-Project
Default Prediction and Stock Market Risk Analysis
Course: Finance and Risk Analytics
The FRA project consists of two parts. Part A focuses on default prediction and financial analysis, aiming to assess a company's ability to meet its debt obligations. Part B involves market risk analysis, where the mean and std deviation of stock returns are calculated to gain insights into stock performance and volatility. These analyses are valuable tools for investors, financial institutions, and stakeholders in making informed decisions related to creditworthiness and investment strategies.

Skills & Tools Covered:
Default Prediction
Financial Analysis
Balance Sheet
Creditworthiness

Gained insight into how investors and credit analysts assess creditworthiness. 📊 2. Market Risk Analysis (Part B): Calculated daily/weekly/monthly returns of stocks to assess historical performance. Learned how to compute mean (expected return) and standard deviation (volatility) of returns. Gained understanding of risk-return trade-off and how volatility affects investment decisions. Explored the use of risk metrics in portfolio management and capital allocation. 📈 3. Financial Modeling & Interpretation: Gained practical experience in analyzing financial statements to derive actionable insights.
